This project is a video game called Honey Grab. It features 2 classes, 3 difficulty settings, 3 hand drawn objects, sound, led output on an arduino board, 
and the option to use a joystick.

The objective of the game is simple: you (the bear) must grab all the honey pots while avoiding the bees. This can be done by default with the arrow keys on the 
keyboard, or, if joystick mode is enabled, with an arduino joystick. You only have 3 lives, each one being lost by colliding with a bee. In addition, there is a 30
second time limit to collect all the honey, or you will lose.

Making this game incorporated everything I had learned from the class. It was very fun to make and I am very pleased with the result. Below is a video of the game in 
action, filmed so that you can see the joystick and led lights.

For future development, I would likely increase the complexity of the soundtrack and draw a background scene, perhaps the inside of a giant beehive.
